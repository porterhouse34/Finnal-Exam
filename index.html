    <li>
      1. Find a web hosting that supports PHP-based programming.
        You need to store and post PHP scripts. 
    <li>
      2. Choose a name.
      What's your website about? That's what the name of your website should be related to.
    </li>
    <li>
      3. Configure PHP
      PHP websites require an SQL database. These must be installed on your domain servers. Remember the username and password, because you will need it in the future
    </li>
    <li>
      4. Next, you'll need a content management system, or CMS, to sort the files you upload into a cohesive website. There are lots of websites that support PHP scripts, such as Wordpress and Joomla. You can download them from these websites, and upload it to your web host. 
    </li>
    <li>
      5. Type the domain name in the browser, and it will starting running and install the CMS script. If this doesn't work you may have to install these manually. 
    </li>
    <li>
      6. Once you install your CMS script, delete the folder, to avoid problems later on. 
    </li>
